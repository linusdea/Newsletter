This Study group aimed to address broad industrial challenges in UQ\&M by tackling three case studies supplied by \textbf{Jaguar Land Rover}, \textbf{Airbus}, and \textbf{Zenotech}. 

The purpose of the Study group was four-fold:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To help companies with established UQ programmes refine their approaches,
    \vspace{5pt}
    \item To help companies new to the field understand the benefit that UQ\&M could have on their operations,
    \vspace{5pt}
    \item To expose UK researchers to the kind of challenges UK industries wish to apply UQ\&M to, and
    \vspace{5pt}
    \item To enable a cross-fertilisation of ideas between disciplines (data scientists, statisticians, numerical analysts etc.).
\end{itemize}

{\bf The Problems and Approaches}

\includegraphics[width=0.5 \textwidth]{studygroup/picts/IMG_1580_lr.jpg}

{\bf Jaguar Land Rover} (JLR) came to the Study Group looking to address how to optimise the ride performance of a vehicle when mass property variations are taken into account, and how UQ\&M could be used to minimise the number of components required to achieve the desired ride performance metrics. Jacqui Morison and Peter Newbury (JLR) outlined their challenge on the Monday morning along with the other industries; all of whom attracted a huge amount of questions and comments. A self-organised group then explored various tasks for JLR including Gaussian process modeling and optimisation (maximising the probability of meeting design specifications), visualisation, robust design and tailored model-based design of experiments.

\includegraphics[width=0.5 \textwidth]{studygroup/picts/IMG_1592_lr.jpg}

Sanjiv Sharma from {\bf Airbus} presented his challenge - Climb-cruise Engine Matching. Sanjiv sought UQ\&M techniques that could better narrow a set of possible aircraft design configurations when uncertainty in introduced. This group explored ideas around history matching (determining input values which relate to a predetermined output range), finding key parameters of interest through global sensitivity analysis, and finding dependencies between inputs and outputs.

David Standingford, Director of {\bf Zenotech} - an SME in the HPC and CFD space - posed the challenge of increasing certainty in offshore energy installations by checking the validity of CFD simulations. It was commented that a fraction reduction in damage caused by unpredicted wake effects could result in substantial cost savings for the energy industry. The Zenotech team worked to calibrate the CFD model with experimental data, create metamodels for the objective function, and use Bayesian optimisation given the expensive computer execution.

    `` At this inaugural event, three industrial case studies were presented during the first morning. This allowed researchers to assess where they wished to contribute, initially. Of course, they were free to move from one industrial case study to another; we maintained continuity by assigning a leader for each group who would stay with the case study and report on the findings. The buzz of conversations that took place to refine the problem statements, propose solutions, and test ideas was exciting - equally so for the industrialists, both as observers and as participants, because we were treated as an integral part of the Study Group. Through these conversations we jointly developed a better understanding of the problem whereby the researchers could seek appropriate solutions. A stimulating aspect of the self-organised researchers was that they were from different universities and different disciplines; yet by working together perhaps they have created opportunities for new collaboration beyond the Study Group.

{\bf Why UQ\&M in Manufacturing?}
Manufacturing contributes over £6.7 tr to the global economy and the UK is a major contributor. In terms of manufacturing Gross Value Added (GVA) the UK is in the world's top 10, generating 10\% of UK GVA. UK manufacturing directly employs 2.5 million people, generates half of UK exports and accounts for three quarters of business R\&D conducted in the UK.

Virtual design through modeling and simulation is extremely attractive for high value manufacturing. Virtual design can:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Significantly speed up the development cycle (i.e. reduction of time from an idea to its implementation, that is very important for complex platforms and products), and
    \item Substitute with simulations some real-life tests necessary in many cases for approval of new materials, designs, platforms etc.
\end{enumerate}
When bringing a new product from conception into production, success rests on the careful management and control of risk in the face of many interacting uncertainties. Historically, chief engineers and project managers have estimated and managed risk using mostly human judgment founded upon years of experience and heritage. As the timescale from concept to commercialisation is eroding, there is decreasing time to build 'experience and heritage', and turnover of personnel and the cost of personnel time both mean that it is not practical to pass on all that 'experience and heritage' to one's successors.

In an era of virtual design, there is an opportunity to handle uncertainty in a systematic way, and create designs robust against these uncertainties. Today's fiercely competitive market and increasingly stringent regulatory environment is such that there is very little margin for error. Failure to understand and manage risks can result in severe financial penalties and even damage to reputation.

%{\bf Current State of Industrial Adoption of UQ\&M}
%Uptake of formal UQ\&M methods in HVM is a mixed bag. A recent project exploring the use of modeling and simulation in HVM performed by NAFEMS, Innovate UK, GE Power and KTN found no best practice was observed across the wide HVM sectors. Few formal programmes of activity were present, and where they were they were generally limited to sensitivity analysis.

%Reasons for the lack of uptake vary from sector to sector; for example those in the process industries stated that data uncertainties were to difficult to capture reliably. Cost, knowledge of decision makers, interpretation, and time all scored highly across HVM sectors

%The Study Group served the purpose of addressing these challenges (amongst various other purposes) in an open, interactive forum. Sharing methods, exploring the real issues to be tackled and providing (in an intense few days of work) evidence for the necessity for such approaches to be of real benefit to all those who attended.

{\bf What next?}
Reports for each case will be written and distributed by the organisers. Additionally, we wish to create a report which is of general interest and use to the wider manufacturing community.

Finally, given the very positive response in outputs and enjoyment of the process we would wish to explore the possibility of running such activities again. If you wish to know more about the 2016 Study Group for UQ\&M, or would like to take part in future activities, please do not hesitate to contact us.

This Young Investigator project funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR) focuses on the dynamical behaviour of complex structures having a high modal density from the low- to the high-frequency band. As an example, an automobile may have about 20,000 elastic modes in the band [0, 2000] Hz. Two main problems arise when trying to construct a computational model for these structures. 

The first one concerns the construction of a low-dimension Reduced-Order Model (ROM), the use of the classical elastic modes being clearly prohibited for complex structures. The second problem is related to the presence, in the computational model, of inherent uncertainties that increase with the frequency.

%\end{wrapfigure}
In this project, a general  multi-level stochastic ROM (SROM) method has been developed to tackle these issues. It allows the construction of a low-dimension ROM for which the very localized non-contributing displacements are filtered. Furthermore, it allows the stochastic fluctuation related to each low-,  mid- and high-frequency ranges to be controlled separately. This method has been applied to linear as well as non linear structures.

In collaboration with the company PSA, 
\begin{wrapfigure}[5]{r}[0pt]{0.2 \textwidth}
\vspace{-10pt}
\includegraphics[width=0.16 \textwidth]{anas/logoLR.jpg}
\end{wrapfigure}
a SROM of an automobile has been constructed and the parameters of this model have been calibrated using experimental frequency responses measured on 20 vehicles from the same production line. The calibrated SROM allows a good prediction of the random dynamical response in the frequency band [0, 1000] Hz.

This project will terminate at the end of 2016. As possible future research to this project, the coupling of this approach with SEA-like methods could extend the domain of predictability of the  SROM to very large frequencies.

Contrary to popular belief, it is uncommon for people to panic or act irrationally during an emergency. However, their behaviour can be unpredictable due to their lack of familiarity with the situation. It is therefore essential that casualties be given clear, concise and direct instructions during emergencies, although this is rarely at the forefront of emergency service training.

Thanks to the partnership between the University of Liverpool’s Department of Psychological Sciences, Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and London Fire Brigade, I have had the opportunity to collect data from responders and casualties in numerous multi-agency training events.

Over the course of my PhD I have been in the unique position of being able to explore casualty perceptions and experiences within a number of national large scale, live, multi-agency exercise involving police, fire and ambulance and their partner agencies.

The first large scale exercise, known as 'Joint Endeavour', involved a train derailing from the tracks and colliding with a building, several vehicles and power lines, which in turn caused a bus to crash into a learning centre. The second large scale exercise, known as ‘Unified Response’, involved a building collapse on Waterloo tube station, which in turn injured hundreds of people. 

Members of the public, Amputees in Action and professional actors played the role of casualties and concerned family members in both exercises to add a level of realism for the  hundreds of practitioners who took part.

Data was collected in the form of pre- and post-event surveys and post-event interviews, which provided a rich, in-depth account of casualty perceptions of how the emergency services interacted with them and how it felt to be a casualty.

This will feed into the work I am conducting to understand public preferences in relation to risk communication in order to aid in the production of adequate guidelines for risk communication training.

In addition to communicating risk information effectively at the acute end of an emergency, informing the public of potential risks and helping them to be prepared in advance can be very useful.

\begin{footnotesize}
Lauren is in the third year of a full time interdisciplinary PhD with the Critical and Major Incident Research group in the Department of Psychological Sciences and the Liverpool Institute of Risk and Uncertainty. 

``The purpose of my PhD research is to identify the most effective ways to communicate risk to the public during an emergency. This is still a fairly novel area of research despite the number of high profile major disasters that have occurred over the last 30 years, such as Fukushima, and the evidence that ineffective risk communication can result in potentially fatal consequences.''

``I have been working with the MRF to develop a website that contains the type of risk and preparedness information that members of the public want to receive. This feedback has been utilised by the MRF to implement appropriate changes before the website went live on 30th October 2014.''

I have also gathered a wider range of public perceptions on the type of information that should be presented in advance of emergencies and how the public can best be helped to be prepared by carrying out a short on-line survey.

%Emergency service resources are finite and the public can be empowered to help themselves and their families, thereby reducing some of the pressure on emergency services and enabling them to use resources more effectively to save lives.

%This is one of the concerns of the Merseyside Resilience Forum (MRF), which is a multi-agency partnership prescribed within the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 that provides guidance and support to the communities of Merseyside in order to improve community resilience.

%I have been working with the MRF to develop a website that contains the type of risk and preparedness information that members of the public want to receive. My initial contribution was to run focus groups with members of the Merseyside public to attain feedback throughout the development stages of the website in order to identify the type of information the public wanted to receive, the level of detail and how such information should be presented. This feedback has been utilised by the MRF to implement appropriate changes before the website went live on 30th October 2014. 

%I have also gathered a wider range of public perceptions on the type of information that should be presented in advance of emergencies and how the public can best be helped to be prepared by carrying out a short on-line survey, the findings of which have been directly fed back to the agencies within the MRF in order to improve their communication and relationship with the public.

The University of Liverpool is part of the core team evaluating the largest disaster training exercise ever staged in the UK.

Exercise Unified Response (EUR) was hosted by the London Fire Brigade as part of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, and involved fire-fighters, police officers and ambulance personnel from across London, the UK and Europe. They took part in a four-day scenario based on a building collapsing onto a major transport hub in the capital. The exercise was designed to test a number of national response frameworks and protocols, but also to test the international cooperation across various EU member states.

\textbf{Observation}\\
To help the emergency services learn from the experience, psychologists from the University’s Critical & Major Incident Psychology (CAMI) research group, from both the Liverpool and London campuses, have been involved throughout the planning and preparation stages of the event. 

The researchers coordinated a number of ’observer’ teams during the live exercise, collecting information on emergency service response, coordination and cooperation, as well as the experience of volunteers playing the part of victims and casualties. The exercise had more than 2,500 casualties, thousands of tonnes of rubble, seven tube carriages and hundreds of emergency service responders.

\textbf{Rescue teams}\\
The major operation involved over 4,000 emergency responders, including 300 responders from European specialist rescue units, representatives from local authorities and other assistance services. 
Dr Michael Humann\footnote{Centre for Critical \& Major Incident Psychology Research, School of Psychology} led the 22-strong University team, which included academic colleagues from the Department of Psychology, as well PhD and MSc students on our academic programme.

%The University was invited to assist with the exercise having supported the Joint Emergency Services Interoperability Programme (JESIP) exercise last year in Liverpool that saw a fire service training station turned into a disaster area as part of the national Home Office funded project.

%Essential
%To date, EUR is just one of the areas in which the CAMI research group has worked with emergency services. They have also assisted with a number of other exercises around Merseyside and the UK, while also developing long-term training and learning programmes.

We are evaluating everything from the command structure to how individual units communicate with one another. This is crucial to help individuals and the services involved perform better in a real crisis. 

Similarly, we are also capturing the public’s experience of their interaction with the various agencies, as well as their overall perceptions of how the emergency services and other authorities train and prepare for such incidents, so as to improve the engagement and information exchange in the future.''

{\textbf{\large About Simon:}}

\begin{scriptsize}

I first studied Geography BSc at the University of Manchester. My studies allowed me to work in public and industrial positions, working at Natural England and hydrological consultancy Cascade Consulting. I returned to academia and studied an MSc in Environmental Modelling, Monitoring, and Reconstruction at the University of Manchester, before undertaking my current PhD in Liverpool. As a researcher I have always had a vested interest in hydrology, from policy and ecology to its cultural presence, however my core passion is flood risk mitigation.

Current research lacks a comprehensive model for estimating the effect of vegetation flow response on flood risk. This is further complicated by the complex and diverse factors involved in river flooding, such as climate gradients, dominant vegetation species, and river morphology. As such, including vegetation in flood models may allow for greater accuracy in flood prediction.

The impacts of climate change are predicted to adversely affect human populations, therefore predicting changes in flood risk is vital for developing adaptive measures. In the UK, concern over river flooding have been exacerbated by recent flooding events and the projected increases in climatic pressures on river flow. An increasing collection of research suggests that interactions between in-stream vegetation and flow conveyance reduces both river velocity and river capacity, increasing local river depth. %This exaggerates local flood risk to populations near vegetated rivers, however it also opens up the possibility for localised flood storage to control flood risk downstream. 


%\end{minipage}
%\vspace{-15pt}


This project aims to enhance river flood prediction by accounting for the effects of in-stream vegetation. Vegetation has so far been absent from hydraulic models and may account for a considerable degree of uncertainty in flood predictions. Previous studies using 2D models have elucidated relationships between vegetation and flow, however 2D approaches are limited due to the 3D nature of plant profiles in the water column, and their agency in turbulence generation. The problem is further complicated by species-specific plant morphology (such as leaf shape and stem flexibility, respectively).% and growing seasons resulting in different effects on flow throughout the year. Climate change is set to alter growing seasons, as well as the intensity and frequency of rainfall, adding another layer of complexity.

To capture the effect of plant-flow dynamics a 3D model must be adopted. Current hydraulic approaches generally favour Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stoke equations (RANS). RANs are used in anisotropic turbulence models with one or multi-equation approaches, and are used to resolve local flow and turbulence induced features through a time-averaged flow field. Flow over or through vegetation can be predicted with RANS models by adding additional source terms to the RANS and turbulence transport equations to account for vegetative drag effects. RANS also offer a practical approach, offering reasonable accuracy of the time-averaged turbulent flow field.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{simon/projectPict.png}
{\scriptsize Simulation of streamwise velocity (m/s) using Telemac 3D in the River }

The project uses TELEMAC 3D, a processing chain for three-dimensional free surface flow for the calculation of water in rivers. TELEMAC was chosen for three reasons: firstly, it is able to model river flooding effectively, solving full 3D non-hydrostatic RANS equations with a free surface; 
secondly, it’s ubiquitous in research and industry, positioning the research project to operate on a field similar to that of other professionals; thirdly, as an open-source model it freely allows for the addition of subroutines to specify complex and important flow phenomena – important for the integration of vegetation in the flood prediction model.

%The premise behind the educational campaigns is that a poor understanding of dog body language leads to greater risk-taking behaviours around dogs. Therefore, education in dog behaviour will decrease the number of bites. However, a recent study indicated that individuals often perceive dog bites as unavoidable, which may pose a barrier to instilling changes in their behaviour around dogs and the effectiveness of education.  
%\begin{wrapfigure}[4]{r}[0pt]{0pt}
%\includegraphics[width=0.2\linewidth]{../../issue_1/sara/royal_trust.png}
%\end{wrapfigure}
%To date, most research around dog bites uses traditional epidemiological approaches (11), which have not offered many insights into differences in individuals' perceptions of bites. Applying qualitative approaches to the study of bites, and in particular, using sociological models of risk is a novel and exciting way to approach this problem.

The Liverpool-based Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Risk \& Uncertainty ran a two-day event, within the Masters of Research (MRes) training programme. Dr Alejandro Diaz, Programme Director of the MRes, and Dr Marco de Angelis, Manager of the CDT, accompanied the second cohort of CDT students to the University of Liverpool’s London Campus. The central location of the campus, in Finsbury Square, is an easy-access meeting point for companies and organisations based in and around the Capital.

The visit provided the Risk & Uncertainty CDT students with opportunities to engage with experts from a broad range of academic and industrial backgrounds. On this occasion, the students met Dr Kimmo Soram{\"a}ki, from Financial Network Analytics (FNA), who gave a lecture on Financial Cartography; namely the understanding of financial risk via correlation networks and other graphical tools.\\

Dr Michael Humann, from the School of Psychology, then gave a lecture on team work and risk communication, in preparation for the training exercise that the CDT students would have to go through later in the week. This was followed by a Q&A session with Dr Humann and Professor Laurence Alison (also from the School of Psychology) on public engagement and risk communication.

Day One finished with an informal networking forum, in the reception area of the London campus building. This was rounded-off by a stunning roof-top visit, which provided wonderful views over the city.

On Day Two of the London trip, Dr Diaz and Dr de Angelis went along with the CDT student group to visit Lloyd’s Register, whose roots in the city of London go back as far as 250 years. There, the students met experts and practitioners in transport classification and energy safety regulations. 

The visit was an exceptional opportunity for the students to acquire knowledge and understanding of risk from a more industry-focused perspective. It was also a chance for them to appreciate the history and evolution of standards and safety regulations. 
After the visit, the students returned to the University’s campus, where they participated in a 10kV test session developed by colleagues from the School of Psychology. This enabled the group to interact with each other and answer questions about decision-making and risk communication, as well as for them to provide feedback on the training module (RISK622) associated with the visit to London.\\

\begin{multicols}{2}
The programme of the Master of Research in Decision Making under Risk and Uncertainty includes a core module called “Assessment and Communication of Risk”. The module examines quantitative tools, industrial experiences and psychological theories relating to the process of decision-making and communicating risk.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{training/Picture6.jpg}

This year one of the master classes was translated into a workshop to train the Master degree students to effectively communicate design decisions to a general audience of stakeholders. At the workshop a group of 4 experts from National Nuclear Laboratories (NNL) were invited to give a presentation and subsequently engage with the students in informal discussion groups.The students’ task was to solve an optimization problem and to try to find the best solution of deployment of a certain amount of radiation sensors to detect a radiation leak or any other potential nuclear threat cost efficiently; and subsequently communicate these findings via a press conference to the general public. 

The students had the opportunity to prepare beforehand for potential questions during the conference and ask NNL experts for their opinion and advice. They had to consider issues such as cost of a false alarm, the location of the sensors – the trip levels near nuclear power plants and elsewhere, the consequences of  missing a real “event”, at what point does the cost of sensors outweigh the potential benefit or the level of perception of potential threat by expert and by public. The task was not easy as the message had to be communicated clearly in a fairly short time frame and no jargon was to be used.
